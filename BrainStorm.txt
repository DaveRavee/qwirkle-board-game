***********************
Tile Placement Logic

- CAN ONLY PLACE ONE LINE
- Can only be placed adjacent to the SAME colour or the SAME shape
- Cannot place if there are other adjacent shapes that are not of the same colour or shape
- THERE MUST BE NO DUPLICATE TILE on the same LINE
- Need method to check up, down, left, right of board 
  - Cases where tile is placed on the edge of board for out of bounds exception

Points
- Count each tile placed on the LINE
- If any of those tiles counted has an extending line COUNT THAT LINE TOO
- If a single line has 6 tiles add 6 bonus points and print "Qwirkle"
- First player to clear their hand gets 6 bonus points
- Game ends, player with the highest number of points wins
